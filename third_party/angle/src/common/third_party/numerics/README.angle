Description:
base::numerics is a library for doing some simple safe math and conversions.
To update the checkout, simply overwrite the base/numerics folder with
Chromium's latest.

Modifications:

- base/logging.h defines CHECK to be ASSERT to be compatible with ANGLE.
- base/numerics/*.h uses namespace angle::base instead of base:: to avoid ODR
  violations when ANGLE code is mixed with Chromium code.
