# This test is a bitcode stability test, which builds pexes for all the tests
# using an old version of the toolchain frontend, and then translates those
# pexes using the current version of the translator. It's simpler than using
# archived pexes, because archived pexes for old scons tests may not match the
# current scons tests (e.g. if the expected output changes or if a new test
# is added). The only thing that would break this approach is if a new test
# is added that is incompatible with the old frontend. For this case there
# simply needs to be a mechanism to disable that test (which could be as simple
# as using disable_tests here on the scons command line).
# Note: If this test is manually interrupted or killed during the run, the
# toolchain install might end up missing or replaced with the old one.
# To fix, copy the current one from toolchains/current_tc or blow it away
# and re-run gclient runhooks.
