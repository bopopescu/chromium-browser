"""Creates a GYP include file for building FFmpeg from source.

The way this works is a bit silly but it's easier than reverse engineering
FFmpeg's configure scripts and Makefiles. It scans through build directories for
object files then does a reverse lookup against the FFmpeg source tree to find
the corresponding C or assembly file.

Running build_ffmpeg.sh for ia32, x64, arm, and arm-neon platforms is required
prior to running this script. The arm and arm-neon platforms assume a
Chromium OS build environment.

Step 1: Have a Chromium OS checkout (refer to http://dev.chromium.org)
  mkdir chromeos
  repo init ...
  repo sync

Step 2: Check out deps/third_party/ffmpeg inside Chromium OS (or symlink it in).
  cd path/to/chromeos
  mkdir deps
  cd deps
  git clone http://git.chromium.org/chromium/third_party/ffmpeg.git

Step 3: Build for ia32/x64 platforms outside chroot (will need yasm in path)
  cd path/to/chromeos/deps/ffmpeg
  ./chromium/scripts/build_ffmpeg.sh linux ia32 path/to/chromeos/deps
  ./chromium/scripts/build_ffmpeg.sh linux x64 path/to/chromeos/deps

Step 4: Build and enter Chromium OS chroot:
  cd path/to/chromeos/src/scripts
  cros_sdk --enter

Step 5: Setup build environment for ARM:
  ./setup_board --board arm-generic

Step 6: Build for arm/arm-neon platforms inside chroot
  ./chromium/scripts/build_ffmpeg.sh linux arm path/to/chromeos/deps
  ./chromium/scripts/build_ffmpeg.sh linux arm-neon path/to/chromeos/deps

Step 7: Exit chroot and generate gyp file
  exit
  cd path/to/chromeos/deps/ffmpeg
  ./chromium/scripts/generate_gyp.py

Phew!

While this seems insane, reverse engineering and maintaining a gyp file by hand
is significantly more painful.
